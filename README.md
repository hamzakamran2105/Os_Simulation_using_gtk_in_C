# Operating System Simulator

**Author**: \Hamza_kamran
**Date**: May 2025

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview

This Operating System Simulator replicates a basic desktop environment using C and GTK on Linux. It allows users to launch multiple applications (tasks) in separate terminal windows, simulating process management, memory allocation, and inter-process communication (IPC).

Each application is launched as a **separate process** using `fork()` and `exec()`. Tasks communicate with the system for resource requests (RAM, HDD) via IPC. A GTK-based desktop interface acts as the main control panel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation Instructions

To compile all components, run:

```bash
make clean && make
```

Or compile individually:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o os_simulator `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Run the desktop simulator with:

```bash
make && make clean
./os_simulator ramSize hardsize no_of_cores
```

Click on any application icon to launch it in a new terminal window.

---

## üì° Features Simulated

* **Process Creation:** Each task is a separate process (`fork()` + `exec()`).
* **Terminal Separation:** Each task opens in its own terminal window.
* **Resource Management:** RAM and HDD resources monitored and allocated.
* **Scheduling:** Task execution is scheduled and managed by `task_manager`.

---

## üìù Notes

* Make sure you have GTK installed (preferably GTK 4).
* Works best on Linux/WSL with terminal emulator support (`xterm`, `gnome-terminal`, etc.).
* Run `chmod +x os_simulator` if the binary is not executable.
